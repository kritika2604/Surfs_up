# Surfs_up
Module 9 : Advanced data storage and retrieval 

## Background:
(Imaginary past) I went to Hawaii and loved my time there. After coming back from my vacation, I felt that it is time for me to switch gears and become my own boss and start a business and invest some of my savings in Surf n’ Shake where I will sell surf boats and shakes. 
I prepared a business plan and presented it to a well-known surfer W. Avy, who already owned a business earlier. He was really serious about this investment I did not want to repeat the mistakes he made in a past business venture, so, he has requested to run a analytics on the weather data he has for the beautiful island of Oahu. 
The analysis was done in the following steps: 
1.	The rain data was checked to see the amount of precipitation received during the duration of 23.08.2016 to 22.08.2017. 
2.	Statistical data was seen to find out the details of precipitation levels.
3.	Number of active and the most active stations were determined. 
4.	Also, analysis on temperature was performed. 
5.	After all the analysis, using Flask, summarized the key ideas of the code in a way that allows people who don't have as much coding experience to understand the results of the code.

With the above analysis complete, it was further investigated how the temperatures are for the months of June and December as sample months for two major seasons for the sales of surf boards and icecream.

### Applications used:
Jupyter notebook file, VS Code and DB browser.

| An acceptable count of temperature data points are found   | An acceptable count of temperature data points are found |
| An average temperature of 74.94. This temperature is very pleasant weather  | An average temperature of 71.04. This temperature is very pleasant weather |
| The maximum temperature ranges from 64 - 85⁰  | The maximum temperature ranges from 56 - 83⁰F. Even snow birds will enjoy in this weather |
| The standard deviation of the entire dataset (=3.25) is not too high which shows that the values are quite evenly distributed   | The standard deviation of the entire dataset (=3.74) is not too high which shows that the values are quite evenly distributed |

## Summary 
With the above analysis results it is very clear that the beautiful island of Oahu, Hawaii is a perfect destination for me to open a business of surf and icecream.
